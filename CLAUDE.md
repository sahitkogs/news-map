# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project context

Vanilla HTML/CSS/JS static site (no build step, no framework). An interactive Leaflet map where users search for any place in the world, add it as a point (up to 10), and see live news (Google News RSS) and YouTube videos for those locations. User locations are stored in localStorage. The geocoder uses Leaflet Control Geocoder (Nominatim, free, no API key).

## Common commands

```bash
# Run locally — needed because file:// blocks cross-file loading
python -m http.server 8766
# then open http://localhost:8766/index.html

# Deploy site to STAGING (default workflow)
git push staging main

# Deploy site to PRODUCTION (only when explicitly requested)
git push prod main

# Deploy Worker to staging
cd cors-proxy && wrangler deploy --env staging

# Deploy Worker to production
cd cors-proxy && wrangler deploy

# Edge cache tests (validates Worker X-Cache HIT/MISS behavior)
bash tests/cache-tests.sh staging       # or "prod"

# Client-side cache tests (validates localStorage behavior, requires playwright)
node tests/client-cache-test.js http://localhost:8766/index.html
```

**Default git remote is `staging`.** Never push to `prod` unless the user explicitly says so. Each environment has its own GitHub repo (GitHub Pages allows only one Pages site per repo) and its own Cloudflare Worker.

## Architecture

### Three-tier data flow

```
Browser (localStorage 2hr TTL)
   ↓ miss
Cloudflare Worker (edge cache 6hr TTL, all users share)
   ↓ miss
Upstream: Google News RSS / YouTube Data API v3
```

The client never talks to Google or YouTube directly. Both `/news/search` and `/youtube/search` endpoints on the Worker do upstream fetch + parse + edge cache. The API key for YouTube is stored as a Worker secret (`wrangler secret put YOUTUBE_API_KEY`), never in client code.

**Why this matters:** YouTube Data API v3 has a 10,000 unit/day quota and search costs 100 units. Without the edge cache, ~5 fresh page loads/day exhausts it. With the cache, 20 search terms × 4 refreshes/day = ~8,100 units regardless of user count. **Don't bypass the Worker, and don't shorten cache TTLs casually.** The cache is doing real load-bearing work.

### Environment routing

`app.js` auto-detects environment by hostname/path and routes to the matching Worker:

| Site | Hostname/path | Worker |
|---|---|---|
| Production | `sahitkogs.github.io/amaravati-tracker/` | `cors-proxy.sahit-koganti.workers.dev` |
| Staging | anything else (incl. localhost) | `cors-proxy-staging.sahit-koganti.workers.dev` |

Local dev hits the staging Worker — safe to break, separate edge cache, separate metrics.

### Sidebar rendering

The sidebar reacts to map viewport changes. `LOCATIONS` from `data.js` are filtered by current map bounds, then articles/videos for those locations are pulled from `articlesByLoc` / `videosByLoc` Maps, deduplicated by URL/videoId, sorted newest-first, and grouped by time bucket (Today / This Week / This Month / Older). Two tabs (Articles, YouTube) share this pipeline.

### Files that matter for understanding

- `data.js` — **Deleted.** User locations are now stored in localStorage and managed via the in-app geocoder search bar.
- `app.js` — Single-file client. Sections: `MAP INIT`, `USER LOCATIONS` (localStorage CRUD), `MARKERS`, `GEOCODER` (search + confirmation panel), `NEWS FETCHING`, `YOUTUBE FETCHING`, `SIDEBAR`, etc. Read the relevant section, not the whole file.
- `cors-proxy/worker.js` — The Cloudflare Worker. `handleYouTubeSearch` and `handleNewsSearch` both follow the same pattern: check `caches.default`, return with `X-Cache: HIT` if found, else fetch upstream and `cache.put` before returning with `X-Cache: MISS`.
- `cors-proxy/wrangler.toml` — Defines top-level (production) deployment and `[env.staging]` override. Each env has independent secrets.

## Testing notes

The cache tests validate two distinct things:

1. **Edge cache** (`tests/cache-tests.sh`) — uses curl, checks `X-Cache` response header. A unique query (timestamp-suffixed) is used to guarantee MISS on first hit and HIT on second hit. News tests gracefully skip when Google returns 502 (it sometimes blocks Cloudflare datacenter IPs — the cache mitigates this since one successful fetch stays cached for 6hr).

2. **Client cache** (`tests/client-cache-test.js`) — uses Playwright, intercepts network requests on a second page load, asserts zero Worker calls for entries already in localStorage. The YouTube portion auto-skips when the daily API quota is exhausted (test detects "no video cards rendered after 30s" and skips rather than fails).

## Things that look like bugs but aren't

- **Console may show 404s for `archives/`** — `.gitignore`'d intentionally, the app doesn't reference these.
- **`.video-feed::after`** — pseudo-element with `flex: 1` and a gradient. This is the fix for the YouTube tab's bottom gap when content is shorter than the viewport. Don't remove unless replacing with something equivalent. See `plans/sidebar-bottom-gap.md` for the full backstory.
- **Worker forwards upstream errors verbatim** — a 403 from the Worker is usually the YouTube API quota being exhausted, not a Worker bug. Hit `https://www.googleapis.com/youtube/v3/search?...&key=...` directly to confirm.
